## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm watch` to rebuild Javascript/Typescript into dist directory
3. Load unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`
4. When some files change, you may need to do a manual reload in the chrome extensions UI

## Todo

- [ ] Error boundary to show errors
- [ ] Swap rule matcher to not use dynamic rules (instead inject and read?)
  - Is this allowed in Manifest v3?
- [ ] Fix packaging step. We're not copying the manifest over and minifying correctly. We're referencing `dist/` in our manifest
- [ ] Add mock setup for dev
- [ ] We may be able to get rid of the background storage worker once we migrate over from dynamic rules
- [ ] Tree shaking isn't happening. Update webpack config to make sure it is. Look at ruleCheck dist w/ navigation.ts
- [ ] Send message to service worker from content script to redirect to page w/ URL
- [ ] For every 10-25 words written, you get 1 minute of the rule dismissed
- [ ] Check on bug with Amazon where rule is hit. Surface the rule hit on the mindfulness check page. It's getting hit but I can't find out why... Might be a dynamic rule... -- I think it was a dynamic rule that stuck around

## Context

In Blocky, we're injecting through content_scripts and here we're redirecting to HTML through a dynamic rule redirect.

## Changes

Actually, we should inject a script on page load that checks the URL of the page. If the URL matches a rule, then we redirect to the extensions page.

## Notes

We're using the service worker to listen for tab updates. It then checks the to see if any rules match, and if so redirects to the mindfulness page. Using content scripts didn't seem to be a good approach and took a while for the script to be laoded in. The service worker is registered immediately and is always listening (ðŸ‘€).
